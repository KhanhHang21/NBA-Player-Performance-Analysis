## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Efficiency in basketball refers to a playerâ€™s overall impact on the game, considering not just their output but how effectively they contribute. This project analyzes key performance metrics to determine how basic player stats correlate with efficiency. It further explores advanced metrics to provide a deeper understanding of what drives true player efficiency.
