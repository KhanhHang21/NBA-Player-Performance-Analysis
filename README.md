# 🏀 NBA Player Performance Analysis

**Do player statistics fully capture performance, or are there overlooked metrics that more accurately define NBA efficiency?**

---

## 📌 Overview

Efficiency in basketball refers to a player’s overall impact on the game, considering not just their output but how effectively they contribute. This project analyzes key performance metrics to determine how basic player stats correlate with efficiency. It further explores advanced metrics to provide a deeper understanding of what drives true player efficiency.

## 📚 Background Information

- Player efficiency is a comprehensive measure of a player’s overall impact on the game, considering both offensive and defensive contributions.

- This study examines key performance metrics, such as Points per Game (PPG), Rebounds per Game (RPG), Assists per Game (APG), and advanced stats like Offensive Rating (ORtg) and Defensive Rating (DRtg), to evaluate efficiency.

- **Dataset** includes NBA player statistics from the 2023–2024 playoffs, capturing a wide range of metrics-  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedsaqibshouqi/2023-2024-nba-player-stats-playoffs
